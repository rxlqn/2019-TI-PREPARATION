function yp = resampleSINC(y,m)
%   TIME-DOMAIN SINC INTERPOLATION (RESAMPLING)
%
%   Syntax:    
%       yp = resampleSINC(y, m)
%
%   Input: 
%         y = input signal to be resampled to higher sampling rate (y must be a row vector)
%
%         m = resampling factor (e.g., if y is 100 sps and yp will be
%                                    200 sps, then m is 200/100 = 2)
%        yp = resampled signal
%
%   Example: Input is 15 Hz sinusoidal signal sampled at 200 sps. It will
%   be resampled to 400 sps using time-domain sinc interpolation
%
%       n = 256;
%       dt = 1/200;
%       t = dt*(0:n-1);
%       T = dt*n;
%       y = sin(2*pi*15*t/T);
%       m = 2;
%       yp = resampleSINC(y,m);
%       u = linspace(0,length(y),length(y));
%       up = linspace(0,length(y),length(y)*m);
%       plot(u,y,'-ob'); hold on; plot(up,yp,'-*r');
